        <h1 class="h3 mb-4 text-gray-800">About the AI-Based Dropout Prediction System</h1>
        <p>This project is a comprehensive Flask application designed to identify students at risk of dropping out and provide actionable insights for counselling and intervention.</p>
        
        <h5 class="mt-4">Core Features</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AI-Powered Predictions:</strong> Utilizes a machine learning model (RandomForest) to predict dropout risk based on various student metrics.</li>
            <li><strong>Explainable AI (XAI):</strong> Integrates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to identify the top factors contributing to each student's risk score, making the AI's decisions transparent.</li>
            <li><strong>Modular Architecture:</strong> Built with Flask Blueprints for a clean and scalable separation of concerns (routes, controllers, models).</li>
            <li><strong>Interactive Dashboard:</strong> A central dashboard provides a high-level overview of student risk trends, summary statistics, and quick access to high-risk profiles.</li>
            <li><strong>Counselling Portal:</strong> Automatically generates rule-based counselling recommendations based on a student's specific risk factors.</li>
            <li><strong>Student Management:</strong> Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing student records.</li>
            <li><strong>Virtual Assistant:</strong> A simple, rule-based chatbot to provide initial student support and guidance.</li>
        </ul>
